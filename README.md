1. Open Visual Studio Code.

2. Open the folder or workspace containing your Flask project.

4. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where your Flask app is located. Use the cd command to change directories.

5. Activate the virtual environment (if you are using one) by running the appropriate activation command. For example, if you are using venv, you can activate it with the following command:

"bash"

"source venv/bin/activate"

6. Once you are in the correct directory and the virtual environment (if any) is activated, run the Flask app with the following command:

"bash"

"flask run"

7. This command will start the Flask development server, and by default, it will listen on http://localhost:5000.

8. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to access your Flask app.
